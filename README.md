## Overview
This is a telegram bot that interacts with Google Sheets and allows you to add, delete, make an expense list and show various graphs.

**Next step?**
- Initial decision screen between Google Sheets and *save data locally* in .csv format with ability to export and share (for those not planning to use gsheet).
- Creation of budgets with alerts if exceeded.

**Improvements?**
- Improve the speed of execution for the elimination of an expense
- Simplify the code and make it more modular 

## Feature
- `Add` expense with two dependent lists, category and subcategory.
- `Delete` expense with pagination to go back through older expenses.
- `Charts` of four types: yearly and monthly breakdowns, trends, and heatmaps.
- `List` to displays a summary of expenses for the current year.
- `Reset` the conversation with the bot.
- `Help` command to information on available commands.
